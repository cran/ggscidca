Description: Decision curve analysis is a method for evaluating and comparing prediction models that incorporates clinical consequences, requires only the data set on which the models are tested, and can be applied to models that have either continuous or dichotomous results. The 'ggscidca' package adds coloured bars of discriminant relevance to the traditional decision curve. Improved practicality and aesthetics. This method was described by Balachandran VP (2015) <doi:10.1016/S1470-2045(14)71116-7>.
